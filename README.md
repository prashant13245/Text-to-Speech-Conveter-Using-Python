# Text-to-Speech-Conveter-Using-Python

🗣️ Text to Speech Converter (TTS) using Python
📝 Project Overview
This project is a Text to Speech (TTS) Converter built using Python. It allows users to input any text and converts it into natural-sounding speech using Python libraries. A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) is provided to make the application simple and interactive.

💡 Features
✅ Convert typed text into speech instantly

🎧 Supports multiple voices (Male/Female – if pyttsx3 is used)

🔊 Adjustable speech rate and volume

📁 Option to save audio as .mp3 file (if using gTTS)

🖥️ Clean and simple Tkinter GUI

🛠️ Technologies Used
Component	Description
Python 3.x	Core programming language
Tkinter	GUI for desktop interface
pyttsx3	Offline text-to-speech engine
gTTS (optional)	Google Text-to-Speech for online conversion
playsound	To play generated audio

🧩 Python Libraries Used
Install required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyttsx3
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound
🖼️ GUI Features
Text box to enter input

"Speak" button to play speech

"Clear" button to reset the text

Optional "Save as MP3" button (if implemented)

Customizable background colors and fonts

📌 How to Run
Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.7 or above recommended)

Install required libraries using pip

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python text_to_speech.py
Type your text, click Speak, and hear it aloud!

🧠 How It Works
pyttsx3 or gTTS is used to convert text to speech

Tkinter GUI takes input from the user

On button click, the speech engine is triggered

Audio is played through system’s default media player

✅ Example Code Snippet (Core Logic)
python
Copy
Edit
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("Hello, welcome to Text to Speech Converter!")
engine.runAndWait()
🔒 Requirements
Python 3.7+

Internet connection (only if using gTTS)

Speakers or headphones
